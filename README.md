### Hi there, I am Carlos 🐔

I am a Machine Learning student 🎓 with a background in computer and electrical engineering, with experience at Ericsson GAIA in the field of object detection and semi-supervised learning. I have also worked in projects related to IoT and Machine Learning in healthcare during my studies.

As for personal projects, I am currently co-founder and CTO at [Riedia](http://www.riedia.com). Our vision is to help expats stay informed and included in society with aggregated local news in English.
